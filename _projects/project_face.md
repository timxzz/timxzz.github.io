title: A Facial Expression Modifier
description: My undergraduate final year project. It is a facial expression modifier that takes a face image and generates images with seven facial expressions while keeping the identity of the input subject unchanged. The algorithm behind is based on a novel deep learning method called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
