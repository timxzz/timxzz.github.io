Hello! I am Tim, also known as Zhenzhong Xiao (肖镇中 in Chinese). 
Currently I am doing my PhD in machine learning at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/home/) with [Robert Bamler](https://robamler.github.io).

Previously, I did a MRes Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at [UCL](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/teaching/courses/) with [David Barber](https://davidbarber.github.io/about/) and a MSc in Computer Science at the [University of Oxford](https://oatml.cs.ox.ac.uk) with [Yarin Gal](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/yarin.gal/website/).
Prior to that I studied computer science at the University of Manchester for my undergraduate. At the time, I also had an one year industrial placement with Morgan Stanley, during which I worked with a global team to create tools for managing and monitoring the cloud platform that has a huge number of servers located around the world.

Just like lots of computer scientists, I have faith in technology. Even though technology won't solve all the problems for you, I believe it will certainly take you closer to the answers.

At the moment, I am very interested in Machine Learning, a field that has amazing impacts on human life.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
